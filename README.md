## Graph
`Graph.cpp` implements a Graph class designed to handle graph structures. The loadGraph function initializes the graph based on a given matrix representation, stored as adjMat, checking properties like symmetry, directedness, and presence of negative edges. The printGraph function outputs essential details about the graph, such as the number of vertices and edges. Overall, this code provides a foundation for working with graph data structures, offering flexibility and functionality for graph analysis and manipulation.

## Algorithms
`Algorithms.cpp` offers a comprehensive set of graph algorithms and data structures. It includes functionalities for connectivity, shortest path finding, cycle detection, and bipartiteness checking. Each algorithm is thoroughly documented, providing developers with a versatile toolkit for graph analysis and manipulation.
